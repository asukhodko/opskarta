"""
Effort metrics computation for opskarta v2.

This module computes effort_rollup, effort_effective, and effort_gap
for all nodes in a plan using a bottom-up tree traversal.

Key concepts:
- effort_rollup: Sum of effort_effective of all direct children
- effort_effective: effort if set, otherwise effort_rollup
- effort_gap: max(0, effort - effort_rollup) - shows incomplete decomposition

Requirements covered:
- 2.6: effort_rollup = sum of effort_effective of direct children
- 2.7: effort_gap = max(0, effort - effort_rollup) when node has effort and children
- 2.8: For leaf nodes, effort_effective = effort
- 2.9: For nodes with children, effort_effective = effort if set, else effort_rollup
